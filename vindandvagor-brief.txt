Hej!

It’s Elsa and Maja here from Vind + Vågor.

We’re thrilled that you’re going to be working on our site, we can’t wait to see what you come up with.

We’ve attached a rough structure for the page and some content (See’01_Website-content’). We’ve also attached our brand guidelines and all of the images that we currently have (See ’02_Brand’ and ’03_Images’) - don’t feel like you have to use them all the images though :)

Another asset we thought might be of use to you are some example pages from a brochure we’re having printed. We’re not looking to replicate this exact layout for our website but hopefully it will give you an idea of our style.

Good luck and speak soon

Elsa + Maja
